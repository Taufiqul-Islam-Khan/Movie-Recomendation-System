**Project Name:** Movie Recommendation System in R Language<br/>
We all are familiar with movie streaming sites. For example, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Voot etc. We watch movies there in our free time. Interesting part is that after watching some movies that platform gives us suggestion related to that movie or that genre. How that is possible! In that case there must be something which gives us that benefit. That is called recommendation system. This system will capable of learning my watching patterns and providing me with relevant suggestions.<br/>
**Project Goal:** The main goal of this project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. To do so we will use machine learning and R as a Language. By this project one will learn how a recommendation system works<br/>
**Dataset:** For this recommendation system, we will use the MovieLens Dataset from Kaggle. The website link is : MovieLens 20M Dataset _ Kaggle.html. We will use Movies.csv and ratings.csv here
